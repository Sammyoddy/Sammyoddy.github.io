It contains data from authors of audiobooks to release dates. The data represents the important details of audiobooks from 1998 till 2025 (pre-planned releases) and it was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehangsude/audible-dataset \"audible dataset\"){style=\"color:blue;\"}. A peek into the Audible dataset indicates that there are some errors and inconsistencies which can be corrected using string manipulation techniques along side other data cleaning techniques.\n\n# [Libraries Used](#libraries)\n\nThe `tidyverse` library is a collection of R packages that can be used in Data Analysis. Some of the packages to be used are the `readr` for data import, `dplyr` for data wrangling, `stringr` for string manipulation to mention a few. Since these packages are housed in the `tidyverse`. I call this library since it is already installed.\n\n```{r}\n#load libraries\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\n```\n\n# [Data Import](#Data)\n\nThe Audible [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehangsude/audible-dataset){style=\"color:blue;\"} is a csv file from Kaggle and in order to deep dive into the data I proceeded to import it into RStudio, the IDE for the R Programming Language.\n\n::: {style=\"background-color:gray;\"}\n```{r}\n#read in audible csv \naudible<-read_csv(\"C:/Users/SAMMY/Desktop/Audible/audible_uncleaned.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\nA peek into the dataset just to get familiar with what the data is about :\n\n```{r}\n#examine dataset \nkable(head(audible,10)) \n```\n\n# [Data Cleaning](#datacleaning)\n\n## Author and Narrator Columns {#authornarrator}\n\nThe [`Author`]{style=\"color:teal;\"} and [`Narrator`]{style=\"color:teal;\"} columns contain the names of the Authors and Narrators of the Audiobooks.\n\n```{r}\n#select Author and Narrator columns\naudible %>% select(author,narrator) %>% head(10) %>%kable()\n```\n\nThese columns in the dataset have a common issue known as string concatenation errors. This occurs when two or more strings are joined together without appropriate spacing or delimiters. In this case, the names of authors and narrators are concatenated without spaces, making it difficult to distinguish between first and last names.\n\nAdditionally, the strings '*Writtenby:*' and '*Narratedby:*' are concatenated with the names, adding unnecessary clutter to our data; hence the need to remove unnecessary strings and add spaces between the names using regular expressions.\n\n::: {style=\"background-color:gray;\"}\n```{r}\n#author and narrator column cleaned of unwanted characters and spaces added where necessary\naudible<-audible %>%mutate_at(vars(author,narrator),\n  ~if_else(str_detect(.,\"(Writtenby:)|(Narratedby:)\"),\n        str_replace_all(str_remove(.,\"(Writtenby:)|(Narratedby:)|\\\\d+\"),\n                        \"(?<=[a-z])(?=[A-Z])\", \" \"),\n        .)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n**cross-check**\n\nIt becomes important to **check** the content of these columns after performing the operation\n\n<div>\n\n```{r}\naudible %>% select(author,narrator) %>% head(5) %>% kable()\n```\n\n</div>\n\n## Time Column {#time}\n\nThe `Time` column is the total duration of each audiobook\n\n```{r}\naudible %>% select(time) %>% head(5) %>%kable()\n```\n\nIt is a column of string datatype and the contents are needed to be extracted and typecasted to numeric values to aid further analysis.\n\n```{r}\n# Create new columns off the time column and typecast to numeric \naudible <- audible %>%\n  mutate(\n    # Extract hours and minutes into separate columns\n    hours = as.numeric(str_extract(time, \"\\\\d+(?=\\\\s*hr)\")),\n    minutes = as.numeric(str_extract(time, \"\\\\d+(?=\\\\s*min)\")),\n    \n    # Convert time to seconds\n    time_seconds = case_when(\n      str_detect(time, \"hrs|hr\") & !str_detect(time, \"mins|min\") ~\n        as.numeric(str_extract(time, \"\\\\d+(?=\\\\s*hr)\")) * 3600,\n      str_detect(time, \"hrs|hr\") & str_detect(time, \"min|mins\") ~\n        as.numeric(str_extract(time, \"\\\\d+(?=\\\\s*hr)\")) * 3600 +\n        as.numeric(str_extract(time, \"\\\\d+(?=\\\\s*min)\")) * 60,\n      str_detect(time, \"mins|min\") ~\n        as.numeric(str_extract(time, \"\\\\d+\")) * 60,\n      TRUE ~ as.numeric(time)\n    )\n  )\n\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## NA values\n\nThe NA values are introduced because there are some observations that may not have either hours or minutes.

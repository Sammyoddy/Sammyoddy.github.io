## Methodology

I followed a structured approach, adhering to the six steps of the data analysis process:

1.  **Ask**: I defined the problem, communicated with stakeholders, and understood the business context. Synergy Ltd. requested an interactive dashboard showcasing game sales trends by region, genre, and platform.

2.  **Prepare**: I obtained the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g25SQHG5yIdIxRw19t0wcgwdGcu70y1O/view?usp=sharing){style="color:blue;"}, ensuring data integrity and cleanliness. Our primary analysis occurred on a duplicate worksheet to preserve the original data.

3.  **Process**: I cleaned and transformed the data, preparing it for visualization.

4.  **Share**: I created an interactive dashboard in Excel, allowing users to explore sales trends based on their preferences.

5.  **Analyze**: I visualized the data, identifying patterns and drawing meaningful conclusions.

6.  **Act**: Our insights informed strategic decisions for Synergy Ltd.

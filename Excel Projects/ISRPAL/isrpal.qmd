## Introduction

The Israel-Palestine conflict has spanned decades, resulting in significant loss of life. The analysis aims to explore fatality trends, identify patterns, and provide insights based on the available data.

The Israel-Palestine conflict from 2000 to 2023 was a period marked by significant events and escalating tensions.This period was characterized by a cycle of violence and attempts at peace negotiations. It‚Äôs important to note that this is a complex issue with deep historical roots and differing narratives.The specific causes of the conflict during 2000-2023 are multifaceted and include:

1\. Al-Aqsa Intifada (2000)

2\. Failed Peace Negotiations (2000)

3\. Political Changes (2001)

4\. Violence and Retaliation (2002)

5\. Roadmap for Peace (2003)

Beyond 2003, the conflict persisted with sporadic violence, peace talks, and ongoing tensions. Efforts toward a lasting resolution continued, but obstacles remained, including territorial disputes, security concerns, and differing visions for the future.

## Overview

**Data Source**: The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/fatalities-in-the-israeli-palestinian){style="color:blue;"}, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com){style="color:blue;"}, contains information about fatalities in the Israel-Palestine conflict. Each record represents an individual who lost their life during specific incidents.

This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/fatalities-in-the-israeli-palestinian){style="color:blue;"} on fatalities related to the Israel-Palestine conflict can be explored to gain insights such as :

**Insights**:

-   **Fatality Trends**

-   **Demographic Analysis**

-   **Geospatial Analysis**

-   **Hostilities Participation Analysis**

-   **Weapons Used**

-   **Perpetrator Profiles**

## Methodology

I followed a structured approach, adhering to the six steps of the data analysis process:

1.  **Define Objective and Stakeholders**: Clearly state the goal (analyze Israel-Palestine fatalities) and identify who needs this information (researchers, policymakers).

2.  **Collect and Validate Data**: Get the fatality dataset and ensure it‚Äôs accurate.

3.  **Clean and Transform Data**: Fix any issues in the data and make it ready for analysis.

4.  **Create Interactive Dashboard**: Build a user-friendly tool for exploring the data.

5.  **Visualize Trends**: Use charts to see patterns (e.g., fatalities over time).

6.  **Draw Conclusions**: Analyze findings (e.g., age disparities, regional impact).

7.  **Inform Decisions**: Share insights to guide conflict resolution efforts. üåçüîç

    ## Examine the Dataset

    A peek into the data; the first 10 rows of data

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
    #load libraries 
    library(knitr)
    library(tidyverse)
    ```

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
    #read in audible csv  
    isrpal <-read_csv("C:/Users/SAMMY/Desktop/Portfoliooo/Sammy Odeyemi/Excel Projects/ISRPAL/isrpal.csv")
    ```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#examine dataset  
kable(head(isrpal,10)) 
```

## Key Dashboard Requirements

#### Key Questions

1.  **Temporal Trends**: How have fatalities evolved over time? Are there specific periods of heightened violence?

2.  **Geographical Patterns**: Which regions (Gaza, West Bank, etc.) have experienced the most fatalities?

3.  **Perpetrators and Targets**: Who are the main perpetrators, and who bears the brunt of the violence (civilians, militants, etc.)?

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Israel-Palestine analysis has yielded valuable insights into the deaths recorded and how distributed they are:

-   **Insights**:

    -   Palestinians suffered a high fatality count at **10,092** and only **1** American Died.

    -   **2014** is peak year for highest death toll at **2326**.

    -   Over **9000** people died by **Gunfire** losely followed by Explosion at **555**

-   These insights can guide strategic decisions for conflict resolution efforts. üïäÔ∏èüåç

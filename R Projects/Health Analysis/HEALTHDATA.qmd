## INTRODUCTION TO HEALTH ANALYTICS WITH R ‚öïÔ∏è {style="color:#004046;"}

<div>

[**Health Analytics** is a rapidly growing field that leverages data analysis to improve healthcare outcomes, optimize operations, and inform policy decisions. By analyzing health-related data, we can uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can lead to better patient care, cost management, and overall health system efficiency.]{style="color:#282c30;"}

[In this project, I use R, a powerful statistical programming language, to analyze a [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gDY_-7nL5KUzLtmSJgI8w0LCiVkFTlDD/view?usp=drive_link){style="color:blue;"} containing various health-related variables. The dataset includes information on individuals‚Äô age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, region of residence, and insurance charges. The goal is to explore how these factors influence health insurance costs and identify key drivers of these costs.]{style="color:#282c30;"}

## [INSTALL NECESSARY PACKAGES]{style="color:#004046;"} üì¶

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("corrplot","ggplot2","tidyr","dplyr","readr","knitr"))
```

The **`install.packages`** function in R is used to install one or more packages from CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network). The codeblock instruction is to install five packages: **`corrplot`**, **`ggplot2`**, **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**, and **`readr`**. Here‚Äôs a brief description of each:

1.  **`corrplot`**: This package is used for visualizing correlation matrices. It provides a variety of methods to display correlations, making it easier to understand the relationships between variables in your dataset.

2.  **`ggplot2`**: A powerful and widely-used package for data visualization. It implements the grammar of graphics, allowing you to create complex and aesthetically pleasing plots with a high degree of customization.

3.  **`tidyr`**: This package helps in tidying your data. It provides functions to reshape and clean your data, making it easier to work with and analyze. Key functions include **`gather`**, **`spread`**, **`separate`**, and **`unite`**.

4.  **`dplyr`**: A package for data manipulation. It provides a set of functions (verbs) that help you perform common data manipulation tasks such as filtering, selecting, mutating, summarizing, and arranging data. It‚Äôs known for its simplicity and speed.

5.  **`readr`**: This package is used for reading rectangular data (like CSV files) into R. It provides functions that are faster and more convenient than the base R functions for reading data.

6.  **`knitr`**: This package is used for dynamic report generation in R. It allows to integrate R code with LaTeX, HTML, Markdown, and other formats, making it easier to create reproducible reports and documents that include both code and output.

## [LOAD LIBRARIES]{style="color:#004046;"}

```{r}
library(corrplot)
library(ggplot2) 
library(tidyr) 
library(dplyr) 
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

By calling these packages, one is equipped with powerful tools to clean, manipulate, visualize, and analyze the health dataset effectively.

## [CHECK WORKING DIRECTORY]{style="color:#004046;"}

```{r}
getwd()
```

The¬†`getwd()`¬†function in R stands for ‚Äúget working directory.‚Äù It returns the current working directory of the R session. The working directory is the folder where R reads and saves files by default. Knowing the current working directory is important because it helps to understand where your files are being stored and accessed from.

## [SET WORKING DIRECTORY]{style="color:#004046;"}

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/SAMMY/Desktop/Portfoliooo/Sammy Odeyemi/R Projects/Health Analysis")
```

The¬†`setwd()`¬†function in R sets the working directory to a specified path. This means R will read and write files from this directory by default.

::: callout-note
## Note

As in your Desktop/Workspace, the Working Directory would be different!

## [ASSUMPTION TEST ON PREDICTOR VARIABLES TO DETERMINE INDEPENDENCE USING CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS]{style="COLOR:#004046;"}

It becomes imperative to convert non-numeric columns in the `healthdata` dataset to numeric values and this is essential for performing further numerical analyses and visualizations

```{r}
#convert to numeric and factors, the columns that are non-numeric 
healthdata$sex<-as.numeric(as.factor(healthdata$sex))
healthdata$smoker<-as.numeric(as.factor(healthdata$smoker))
healthdata$region<-as.numeric(as.factor(healthdata$region))
```

```{r}
#USING SCATTERPLOTS AND CORRELATION MATRIX 
corr_matrix<- cor(healthdata[,c("age","sex","bmi","children","smoker","region","charges")])
corr_matrix
```

In this block of code, we calculate the correlation matrix for selected variables in the **`healthdata`** dataset. This matrix helps in understanding the linear relationships between pairs of variables such as `age`,¬†`sex`,¬†`bmi`,¬†`children`,¬†`smoker`,¬†`region`, and¬†`charges`.

```{r}
#Visualizing for correlation 
corr_colors <- colorRampPalette(c("#E0F2F1", "#007D76"))(100) 
corrplot(corr_matrix,method="color",addCoef.col = "black",col=corr_colors)
```

Above is a color-coded plot that clearly shows the strength and direction of relationships between the variables, aiding in the identification of patterns and potential multicollinearity.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Interpretation of Correlation Matrix

-   **Age**: Positively correlated with **`charges`** (0.299).

-   **Sex**: Weak correlations with all variables.

-   **BMI**: Positively correlated with **`charges`** (0.198) and **`region`** (0.158).

-   **Children**: Weak correlations with all variables.

-   **Smoker**: Strongly correlated with **`charges`** (0.787).

-   **Region**: Weak correlations with all variables.

-   **Charges**: Strongly correlated with **`smoker`** (0.787), moderately with **`age`** (0.299) and **`BMI`** (0.198).

Key relationships: **`smoker`** and **`charges`** (strong), **`age`** and **`charges`** (moderate), **`BMI`** and **`charges`** (moderate). Other variables show weak correlations.
:::

```{r}
pairs(~ age + sex + bmi + children + smoker + region + charges, data = healthdata)
```

The above chart and block of code helps in visualizing a pairwise relationship between the variables.

A scatterplot matrix is visualized, where each cell in the matrix is a scatterplot of one variable against another.

## RESIDUALS AND FITTED VALUES FOR LINEAR MODEL 1 {style="color:#004046;"}

The codeblock below calculates the residuals and fitted values for the linear regression model¬†`lm1`¬†and stores them in a data frame:

```{r}
#Calculate residuals and fitted values for residuals
residualslm1<-data.frame(residuals=resid(lm1), Fitted=fitted(lm1))
```

**Description**:

-   **Residuals**: Differences between observed and predicted values from **`lm1`**.

    -   **`resid(lm1)`**: Extracts residuals from **`lm1`**.

-   **Fitted Values**: Predicted values from **`lm1`**.

    -   **`fitted(lm1)`**: Extracts fitted values from **`lm1`**.

```{r}
#Create Visuals for Residuals and Fitted Values  
ggplot(residualslm1, aes(Fitted,residuals))+
  geom_point(aes(color="#004046")) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0,linetype="dashed",color="#004046")+
  labs(title = "Residuals vs Fitted Plot", x="Fitted Values",y="Residuals")+   theme_minimal()
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Interpretation of the Residuals vs Fitted Plot

The plot visualizes the residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) against the fitted values from your linear regression model.

**Key Observations**:

-   **No Clear Pattern**: The residuals are scattered randomly around the horizontal dashed line at zero, indicating no obvious pattern.

-   **Homoscedasticity**: The spread of residuals appears consistent across all fitted values, suggesting constant variance (homoscedasticity).

-   **Outliers**: There are a few points far from the zero line, which might be outliers.

**Conclusion**:

-   The random scatter and consistent spread suggest that the model‚Äôs assumptions are reasonably met.

-   The lack of a clear pattern indicates that the model does not suffer from major issues like non-linearity.
:::

### Q-Q Plot of Residuals

The Q-Q plot compares the residuals‚Äô quantiles to a normal distribution‚Äôs quantiles.

```{r}
#QQ Plot of Residuals
ggplot(residualslm1, aes(sample=residuals))+   stat_qq(color="#004046")+   stat_qq_line(color="#004046")+   labs(title = "Q-Q Plot of Residuals", x="Theoretical Quantiles",y="Sample Quantiles")+   theme_minimal()
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
#### Interpretation:

-   **Central Points**: Residuals are approximately normally distributed.

-   **Deviations at Extremes**: More extreme residuals than expected, indicating heavier tails.

#### Conclusion:

The residuals deviate from normality at the extremes, suggesting potential issues with the model‚Äôs assumptions. Consider transformations or alternative models.
